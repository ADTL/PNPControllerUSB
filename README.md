Mach 3 to Smooth Stepper Ethernet Pick and Place software USB Controller
====================
This application is a work in progress build to run a DIY pick and place machine via Mach3 to a SmoothStepper Ethernet control board and custom USB host controller for IO and motor control.

Full details of this project are on my blog at http://www.briandorey.com/ and the USB controller board at http://briandorey.com/post/diy-pick-and-place-usb-controller-board.aspx

The project was built under Visual Studio 2013 and you need to have Mach3 installed and add a reference to the Mach3.exe in Visual Studio

Mach3 and this application need to be run with Administrator user rights otherwise the API often crashes.
